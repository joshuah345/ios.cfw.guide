## Required Reading

iOS and iPadOS devices can typically only update to firmware versions which Apple has "signed". This usually means that you can only update to the most recent firmware versions. This is bad for jailbreaking, as most jailbreaks rely on exploits that have been patched in newer versions.

Fortunately, we can use different "profiles" to delay a firmware update. This is intended for organisations which require additional time to update their devices, however we can also use these to update to unsigned firmware versions.

This has a time limit, however. You will only be able to update to the following firmware versions before their respective expiration dates:

- **14.8.1** -  March 13th, 2022
- **15.1 (All devices excluding iPhone 12/13 series)** - March 13th, 2022
- **15.1.1 (iPhone 12/13 series)** -  March 13th, 2022

Time is given in `UTC 00:00`. For more expiration dates, view [dhinakg.github.io/delayed-otas.html](https://dhinakg.github.io/delayed-otas.html).

::: danger

If you trying to go to iOS 15.1.1, you will likely run into issues. If you run into these issues, there is no solution.

:::

::: danger

Depending on your target iOS version, you won't be able to do this if you futurerestored after the following dates:

  - 14.8.1: September 20th, 2021
  - 15.1: December 13th, 2021
  - 15.1.1: December 13th, 2021

:::

::: tip

If you are trying to update to iOS 14.8.1, you need to be on iOS 14.5 to 14.8. If you are on iOS 14.4.2 or lower, follow <router-link to="/updating-dallas">Updating (Dallas)</router-link> instead.

:::

::: tip

You must have a jailbreak to follow these instructions. If you cannot jailbreak, follow <router-link to="/updating-blobless-advanced">Updating (Blobless) (Advanced)</router-link> instead.

## Preparing

1. Plug your iDevice into your computer and make a backup through iTunes or Finder
1. Launch your current jailbreak
1. Open your preferred package manager and add the following repo: [https://cydia.ichitaso.com/](https://cydia.ichitaso.com/)
1. Search and install the `SupervisedEnabler` package
1. Reboot your device (You can also use ldrestart or perform a userspace reboot)
1. Your device should now be supervised
    - You can check by going into the settings app, where a message should be present at the top indicating so. If there isn't, attempt to reinstall `SupervisedEnabler`
1. Once you're back into your device, navigate to this webpage
1. Tap a version below to install its respective update profile:
    - [14.8.1](/assets/files/delay_14_8_1_alternate.mobileconfig)
    - [15.1](/assets/files/delay_15_1.mobileconfig)
    - [15.1.1](/assets/files/delay_15_1_1.mobileconfig)
    - For more firmware versions, view [dhinakg.github.io/delayed-otas.html](https://dhinakg.github.io/delayed-otas.html).

## Restoring rootFS

1. Open the Settings application
1. Tap `General` -> `Software Update`
1. Ensure that the version displayed is the version you are intending to update to
    - **Do not** update yet, we will do this later
1. Open your current jailbreak and restore rootFS
    - If you need a detailed guide on how to restore rootfs, follow <router-link to="/restoring-rootfs">Restoring Rootfs</router-link> and select the jailbreak which you currently use
1. Reboot your device

## Updating your firmware version

1. Plug your device into power and connect to the Internet with Wi-Fi
1. Open the Settings application
1. Tap `General` -> `Software Update`
1. Ensure that the version displayed is the version you are intending to update to
1. Download and install the update
1. Once updated, remove the update profile and (if applicable) the beta profile through Settings

If you're having issues with updating, install [OTAEnabler](https://repo.cadoth.net/) and reboot. If you're still having issues continue reading below. 

::: tip

To remove supervision after updating, either jailbreak and then reinstall then uninstall SupervisedEnabler, or erase all content and settings and restore a backup made prior to becoming supervised.

:::

::: tip

If the update was successful, continue to <router-link to="/get-started">Get Started</router-link> to jailbreak your device.

:::

## Troubleshooting

::: tip

If you needed to use OTAEnabler, and you needed to modify the Beta Profile in previous steps, you'll need to repeat that section after using OTAEnabler.

:::

### "iOS is up to date"

1. Remove any beta profiles installed
1. Install the OTADisabler tweak and then uninstall it
1. Restart your device
    - You can also use ldrestart or a userspace reboot

### "Unable to check for updates"

1. Restore rootFS through your jailbreak
1. Install and open the <router-link to="/installing-unc0ver">unc0ver</router-link> application
1. Turn off "Block Automatic Updates"
1. Re-jailbreak using unc0ver

### It just freezes

Re-enable the OTA daemon using the iCleaner tweak
